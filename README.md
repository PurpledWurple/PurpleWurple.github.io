this is my github account I created for school projects last year, I didnt end up using it that much though...

This is a test repository to test out girhub desktop & git, I am pretty used to using github but I have only used git sparingly

I first made a repo on github, then cloned the repo onto my hard drive, edited it in VScode, then commited my changes onto the repo

Thats it :I
